Tournament
=============

The tournament database is set up by running the tournament.sql file.  Note that if
the file is re-run, ALL data will be destroyed and a new database is constructed using 
the same table database and table names.

The tournament.py file contains all of the necessary functions for the tournament application.

The tournament_test.py file serves not only as a test-bed for the correctness of the tournament.py 
file but also as an example of how to use each of the functions.
